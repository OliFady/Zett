## Highlights
They found that when many office workers shifted to logging in from home instead of the office, the length of the average workday increased by 13%, or 46 minutes, in the two years after the pandemic began in March 2020.7 And where traditionally most professional workers had two productivity peaks in their day, before and after lunch, the same researchers observed the emergence of an additional peak since the pandemic, with a third bump of work taking place in the late evening. They call this phenomenon a ‘triple peak day’. — location: [456]() ^ref-60221

The next month, another salary is deposited and the cycle repeats again. This continues over and over, until work becomes primarily a means of getting enough money to pay for the lifestyle you’ve developed. There’s even a term for this: lifestyle inflation. It helps to explain why the more your salary increases, the more you spend, until you realise you’re caught in a common, dangerous rip that’s hard to get out of. Most of us repeat this cycle over and over, with very few chances to draw breath, until we retire. No wonder we feel overworked, disengaged and apprehensive. — location: [514]() ^ref-46671

you’ll notice something unusual: a single ladder – five rungs, wooden – leaning casually up against the wall. It looks like a tradesman may have left it there and will return any minute now to pick it up. But nobody will be moving it. This rogue ladder has been leaning against the facade of the church since at least 1728, when a black and white engraving of the building first captured it there.2 For three centuries it’s remained stuck in place, because none of the six groups can agree on who should be the one to move it. This solitary ladder is a stubborn tribute to doing nothing, purely because that’s the way things have always been done. The immovable ladder of Jerusalem is an extreme example of what happens when you get so blinded by the mirage of stability that you give up on trying to make any sort of change. — location: [629]() ^ref-52258

My regular walk to and from the office, from leafy Paddington to trendy Surry Hills, was one of my daily highlights. I’d intentionally bought a house within a 15-minute radius of our office, believing that the ability to walk to work was one of the true simple pleasures of life. — location: [903]() ^ref-33101

The story goes that one day, a young man walked past three workers who were toiling away laying bricks for what would eventually become one of the Cathedral’s internal walls. He asked the first bricklayer what he was doing. ‘I am laying bricks,’ he said, ‘working hard to feed my family.’ The young man walked further along, and asked the second bricklayer what he was doing. ‘I’m constructing a wall,’ he responded. ‘I’m a builder and I’m helping to rebuild this cathedral.’ The young man walked along to the third bricklayer, and repeated the same question: ‘What are you doing?’ The third man puffed his chest out and responded with pride. ‘I am building the house of God.’ — location: [1221]() ^ref-6162

Job: A lot of us simply have a job that we do. When you think of work as a job, you tend to focus on the financial rewards that you receive for doing the work, without gaining much additional satisfaction or fulfilment from it. People who consider work as a job typically angle their life outside the workplace, thinking of work primarily through the lens of what they can do with the money they earn from it. You know you have a job when the purpose of work is just to make money. Career: This is where you work for a pay cheque, but also something more. You might have an interest in being promoted, in getting more training to help you perform the job better, or you might enjoy being part of an environment where you feel you are learning and progressing. Those with a career focus on advancement and moving up the ‘ladder’. You know you have a career when the purpose of work is to build skills and to grow professionally. Calling: Some people are able to find a deep alignment between their own personal values and the work that they do. They might feel an emotional connection to their work, and that often means they work harder, longer and with a deep sense of enthusiasm. You know you have a calling when the purpose of work is to make a positive difference. — location: [1230]() ^ref-50032

One of the biggest fallacies of modern management theory is that every job you have has to be meaningful. It doesn’t – you just have to have some meaning in it, not zero. — location: [1286]() ^ref-65467

Researchers have identified four main, and equally valuable, sources of meaning in work2: service to others, realising your full potential, unity with others and self-integrity — location: [1292]() ^ref-30408

Tasks: You can actively decide to take on more or fewer tasks to improve the way you feel about your job. For example, if you have an interest in design, you can try to spend more time using programs like Canva or Photoshop to create your own designs for work projects. The more of this you do, the more likely you are to foster feelings of deeper meaning at work. On the flipside, if you detest certain tasks, trying to spend less time on them will make you feel better about work. To shape your job, you can add tasks, emphasise areas you like or redesign them to make them more meaningful. Relationships: You can alter which interpersonal relationships to lean into and which to decrease in order to improve your work environment. To create more meaning at work, build relationships with people you want to spend time with, reframe existing relationships in a more positive light, or adapt how you interact with others through initiatives such as mentoring, which benefits both parties. Cognitive: Lastly, you can change the way you think about your job on a wider scale. This one requires some mental gymnastics in order to reframe your motivations. Take the example of an administrative assistant whose job is to keep the office tidy, organise calendars and perform other odd jobs. They can think about their role in terms of the tasks they have to do, or they can reframe it cognitively, seeing their job as helping make other people’s lives easier. This simple flip can allow you to find more meaning, just by thinking about it differently. — location: [1359]() ^ref-26222

All of this brings us to a way of rebalancing our activities to be more in line with the direction we should be heading in. Instead of prioritising work ahead of everything else, we need to take a more holistic view, aiming for a full-circle life where each of the four quadrants of work, relationships, body and mind are all given roughly equal time and attention. This is what that looks like: — location: [1812]() ^ref-59261

Early career: At this stage of your life, it’s natural to start off living from pay cheque to pay cheque, as you haven’t had time to build up decent savings. You’re probably not getting paid much, but you should also hopefully have fewer expenses and things to spend money on. At some stage, however, you have to stop spending everything that comes in. There are simple things you can do to help with this, like paying bills on time so you don’t incur late fees, and avoiding a credit card for as long as you can. But the biggest change you can make at this stage is to be conscious of exactly where your money is going. You can then decide if it’s being spent on areas of your life that align with your MAP, which we clarified in the first step. Mid career: This is usually the stage of your life when you’re earning the highest amount of money. Years of working hard, gradual job promotions, consistent saving, switching companies, pay rises, or the accumulation of bonuses or stock options are all common ways that you can shore up your finances to help you break the work-and-spend cycle. But the biggest thing you can do to smash your way out of it is actually easier than all of those: it’s knowing what your ‘enough’ is, and being content with that. You can use your years of experience to better understand yourself and what makes you happy. Late career: The work-and-spend cycle is tiring, and if you’re still stuck deep in it at this point, it can be more difficult to break out of it. By this stage your lifestyle and life expenses are pretty baked in. However, just because it’s the way you’ve always done things doesn’t mean it’s the way they always have to be. The best thing you can do is use your experience to your advantage, and deeply interrogate what has and hasn’t fulfilled you up to now. — location: [2457]() ^ref-25647

‘Scientists have studied the relationship between money and happiness for decades and their conclusion is clear: money buys happiness, but it buys less than most people think,’ wrote Elizabeth Dunn, Daniel Gilbert and Timothy Wilson in their 2011 report ‘If money doesn’t make you happy, then you probably aren’t spending it right’. — location: [2636]() ^ref-24991
