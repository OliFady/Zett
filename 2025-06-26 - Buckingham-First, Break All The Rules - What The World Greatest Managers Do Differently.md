# First, Break All The Rules - What The World Greatest Managers Do Differently
## Metadata
* Author: Marcus Buckingham
## Highlights
Do it fast, the faster the better. If someone is consistently underperforming, you might think you are doing them a favor by waiting. You aren’t. You’re actually making matters worse. — location: [221]() ^ref-49892

---
If you expect the best of people, they’ll give you the best. I’ve rarely been let down. And when someone has let me down, I don’t think it is right to punish those who haven’t by creating some new rule or policy. — location: [228]() ^ref-8170

don’t over-promote people. Pay them well for what they do, and make it rewarding, in every way, for them to keep doing what they are doing. Brad is a great waiter, but he would make a terrible manager. He loves to perform for an audience he respects. He respects the customers. He is less respectful of some of the new employees. As a manager, these employees would be his audience. — location: [230]() ^ref-47594
A manager has got to remember that he is on stage every day. His people are watching him. Everything he does, everything he says, and the way he says it, sends off clues to his employees. These clues affect performance. So never forget you are on that stage. — location: [239]() ^ref-22526
Make very few promises to your people, and keep them all. — location: [236]() ^ref-53180

many companies know that their ability to find and keep talented employees is vital to their sustained success, but they have no way of knowing whether or not they are effective at doing this. — location: [268]() ^ref-58374
the only way to generate enduring profits is to begin by building the kind of work environment that attracts, focuses, and keeps talented employees. — location: [270]() ^ref-64801
This is why, in tight labor markets, companies seem prepared to go to almost any lengths to prevent employees’ eyes from wandering. — location: [273]() ^ref-52293
Institutional investors have always been the ultimate numbers guys, representing the cold voice of massed shareholders, demanding efficiency and profitability. Traditionally they focused on hard results, like return on assets and economic value added. Most of them didn’t concern themselves with “soft” issues like “culture.” In their minds a company’s culture held the same status as public opinion polls did in Soviet Russia: superficially interesting but fundamentally irrelevant. — location: [290]() ^ref-26918
Thomas Stewart describes in Intellectual Capital, “the most essentially human tasks: sensing, judging, creating, and building relationships.” This means that a great deal of a company’s value now lies “between the ears of its employees.” And this means that when someone leaves a company, he takes his value with him — more often than not, straight to the competition. — location: [298]() ^ref-25138

Measuring the strength of a workplace can be simplified to twelve questions. These twelve questions don’t capture everything you may want to know about your workplace, but they do capture the most information and the most important information. They measure the core elements needed to attract, focus, and keep the most talented employees. Here they are: Do I know what is expected of me at work? Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right? At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day? In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for doing good work? Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person? Is there someone at work who encourages my development? At work, do my opinions seem to count? Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel my job is important? Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work? Do I have a best friend at work? In the last six months, has someone at work talked to me about my progress? This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow? — location: [376]() ^ref-19950
Second, you may be wondering why there are no questions dealing with pay, benefits, senior management, or organizational structure. There were initially, but they disappeared during the analysis. This doesn’t mean they are unimportant. It simply means they are equally important to every employee, good, bad, and mediocre. Yes, if you are paying 20 percent below the market average, you may have difficulty attracting people. But bringing your pay and benefits package up to market levels, while a sensible first step, will not take you very far. These kinds of issues are like tickets to the ballpark — they can get you into the game, but they can’t help you win. — location: [401]() ^ref-35295
This is what we found. First, we saw that those employees who responded more positively to the twelve questions also worked in business units with higher levels of productivity, profit, retention, and customer satisfaction. This demonstrated, for the first time, the link between employee opinion and business unit performance, across many different companies. Second, the meta-analysis revealed that employees rated the questions differently depending on which business unit they worked for rather than which company. This meant that, for the most part, these twelve opinions were being formed by the employees’ immediate manager rather than by the policies or procedures of the overall company. We had discovered that the manager — not pay, benefits, perks, or a charismatic corporate leader — was the critical player in building a strong workplace. The manager was the key. — location: [443]() ^ref-43912
It tells us that people leave managers, not companies. — location: [474]() ^ref-65015

Great managers reject this out of hand. They remember what the frog forgot: that each individual, like the scorpion, is true to his unique nature. They recognize that each person is motivated differently, that each person has his own way of thinking and his own style of relating to others. They know that there is a limit to how much remolding they can do to someone. But they don’t bemoan these differences and try to grind them down. Instead they capitalize on them. They try to help each person become more and more of who he already is. — location: [813]() ^ref-40424
People don’t change that much. Don’t waste time trying to put in what was left out. Try to draw out what was left in. That is hard enough. — location: [818]() ^ref-61685
It explains why great managers do not believe that everyone has unlimited potential; why they do not help people fix their weaknesses; why they insist on breaking the “Golden Rule” with every single employee; — location: [823]() ^ref-1813
Select a person, set expectations, motivate the person, and develop the person: these are the four core activities of the “catalyst” role. If a company’s managers are unable to play this role well, then no matter how sophisticated its systems or how inspirational its leaders, the company will slowly start to disintegrate. — location: [890]() ^ref-8912
When selecting someone, they select for talent … not simply experience, intelligence, or determination. When setting expectations, they define the right outcomes … not the right steps. When motivating someone, they focus on strengths … not on weaknesses. When developing someone, they help him find the right fit … not simply the next rung on the ladder. — location: [992]() ^ref-20135
Your talents, they say, are the behaviors you find yourself doing often. — location: [1014]() ^ref-2993
The key to excellent performance, of course, is finding the match between your talents and your role. — location: [1018]() ^ref-19013

First, you cannot teach talent. You cannot teach someone to form strong opinions, to feel the emotions of others, to revel in confrontation, or to pick up on the subtle differences in how best to manage each person. You have to select for talents like these. — location: [1043]() ^ref-15315
You have a filter, a characteristic way of responding to the world around you. We all do. Your filter tells you which stimuli to notice and which to ignore; which to love and which to hate. It creates your innate motivations — are you competitive, altruistic, or ego driven? It defines how you think — are you disciplined or laissez-faire, practical or strategic? It forges your prevailing attitudes — are you optimistic or cynical, calm or anxious, empathetic or cold? It creates in you all of your distinct patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior. In effect, your filter is the source of your talents. — location: [1111]() ^ref-51417
Striving talents explain the why of a person. They explain why he gets out of bed every day, why he is motivated to push and push just that little bit harder. Is he driven by his desire to stand out, or is good enough good enough for him? Is he intensely competitive or intensely altruistic or both? Does he define himself by his technical competence, or does he just want to be liked? Thinking talents explain the how of a person. They explain how he thinks, how he weighs up alternatives, how he comes to his decisions. Is he focused, or does he like to leave all of his options open? Is he disciplined and structured, or does he love surprises? Is he a linear, practical thinker, or is he strategic, always playing mental “what if?” games with himself? Relating talents explain the who of a person. They explain whom he trusts, whom he builds relationships with, whom he confronts, and whom he ignores. Is he drawn to win over strangers, or is he at ease only with his close friends? Does he think that trust must be earned, or does he extend trust to everyone in the belief that most will prove worthy of it? Does he confront people dispassionately, or does he avoid confrontation until finally exploding in an emotional tirade? — location: [1265]() ^ref-11588
“Habit” is another potentially confusing term. We have been told that our habits are second nature. We have been told that we can all change this nature and acquire new habits. Again, this advice is well-intended but inaccurate. Most habits are our first nature. Most habits are talents. If you are habitually assertive or habitually empathic or habitually competitive, then you are going to have a tough time changing these habits. They are enduring. They make you You. It’s potentially disastrous to suggest that the only way to become more effective is to try to change your first nature. Of course, this doesn’t mean that you cannot change some of your behaviors. You can. Over time, through reflection, you might change your values and so learn a more positive and productive way to apply your talents. — location: [1341]() ^ref-54624
“If I find myself telling the same person to ‘look on the bright side’ time and time and time again, I should take a hint. He’s not a bright-sider. He’s a dark-sider. I should stop wasting my breath and try to find a role where skepticism is key to success.” — location: [1361]() ^ref-2811
Take the striving talent of competitiveness as an example. Some people have a four-lane highway for competition. Show them scores and they will instinctively try to use these scores to compare their performance with that of their peers. They love scores, because what you can measure you can compare; and if you can compare, you can compete. However, people with a wasteland for competition will see the same scores and not feel any jolt of energy at all. Putting themselves on a level playing field, pitting their best efforts against their peers, and winning … means nothing to them. They rationalize their behavior by opining, “I don’t like competition; I prefer win-win scenarios,” or the classic, “I prefer to compete with myself.” But these comments are just signs that their filter is, understandably, trying to describe itself in the most positive light. The truth is that they are not competitive. There is nothing good or bad about this. It is simply who they are. And there is not much that either they or you, their manager, can do about it. — location: [1368]() ^ref-22732
A manager can never breathe motivational life into someone else. All she can do is try to identify each employee’s striving four-lane highways and then, as far as is possible, cultivate these. — location: [1389]() ^ref-35832
The best way to help an employee cultivate his talents is to find him a role that plays to those talents. — location: [1404]() ^ref-23915

Apparently not. Apparently it all came down to what the nurse said to the patient right before the needle punctured the skin. The average nurses introduced themselves with a brisk, “Oh, don’t worry, this won’t hurt a bit,” and then plunged in the needle with businesslike efficiency. The best nurses opted for a very different approach. They were just as efficient with the needle, but they set the stage rather more carefully. “This is going to hurt a little,” they admitted. “But don’t worry, I’ll be as gentle as I can.” — location: [1412]() ^ref-58091
Take nursing as an example. Working with a large healthcare provider, Gallup had a chance to study some of the best nurses in the world. As part of our research we asked a study group of excellent nurses to inject one hundred patients and a control group of less productive nurses to perform the same injection on the same population of one hundred patients. Although the procedure was exactly the same, the patients reported feeling much less pain from the best nurses than from the rest. Why? What were the best nurses doing to lessen the pain? Did they have some special technique with the needle? Did they apply the disinfectant using a firmer hand or a softer swab? Apparently not. Apparently it all came down to what the nurse said to the patient right before the needle punctured the skin. The average nurses introduced themselves with a brisk, “Oh, don’t worry, this won’t hurt a bit,” and then plunged in the needle with businesslike efficiency. The best nurses opted for a very different approach. They were just as efficient with the needle, but they set the stage rather more carefully. “This is going to hurt a little,” they admitted. “But don’t worry, I’ll be as gentle as I can.” The best nurses were blessed with the relating talent empathy. They knew the injection would hurt, and each of them, in their own style, felt compelled to share that knowledge with the patient. Surprisingly, this confession eased the patients’ pain. To the patients it seemed as though the nurse were, in some small way, going through the experience with them. The nurse was on their side. The nurse understood. So when the needle broke the skin, somehow it didn’t feel as bad as they thought it would. — location: [1407]() ^ref-35669
Similarly, some people are fascinated with risk. This striving talent is neither a good thing nor a bad thing, although it can prompt some otherwise normal people to hurl themselves out of planes or swim with great white sharks just for the fun of it. However, if these people become anesthesiologists or surgeons, then their four-lane highway for risk becomes a positive strength. For them, the literal life-or-death quality of their work is a thrill, not a pressure. They are special, these people. They are “talented.” — location: [1422]() ^ref-15585

## Notes

- If a person is always under performing, fire them fast. You'd be doing them a favor. On the other hand, if the person is doing well, don't over promote them. instead give them a good raise and keep the job rewarding for them.
- The Author suggests 12 questions which he found were key metrics to how people were feeling about the organization. Most of which were about the employees well being. no pay, pizza or parties involved.
-  Great managers select for talent, talent is what you do everyday.
- People with striving talent can turn life-death situations into a thrill instead of a pressure.
