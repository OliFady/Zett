## Notes

- Meredith tells us that feeling anxious is actually a good thing, some might say that it means you're still alive. But also holding on to that feeling might help us know it's triggers once it's over.
- A simple catchphrase can go a long way in helping with your self affirmations. It can help u recognize when you're talking in a bad way to your self.
- Naming things around you can help in grounding. One of these things are colors. Certain colors may make you feel more anxious while other calm you down.
- Creating a to-do list specially when gamifying it can help motivate you accomplish your daily tasks. This -of course- doesn't replace discipline.
- Morning journaling can help in self discovery. One to three pages may be enough of free writing to start your morning.
