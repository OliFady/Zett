---
A warrior does not spend his days trying to play the role that others have chosen for him. — location: [116]() ^ref-34296

'Although I have been through all that I have, I do not regret the many hardships I met, because it was they who brought me to the place I wished to reach. Now all I have is this sword and I give it to whomever wishes to continue his pilgrimage. I carry with me the marks and scars of battles - they are the witnesses of what I suffered and the rewards of what I conquered. — location: [136]() ^ref-32645

---
These are the beloved marks and scars that will open the gates of Paradise to me. There was a time when I used to listen to tales of bravery. There was a time when I lived only because I needed to live. But now I live because I am a warrior and because I wish one day to be in the company of Him for whom I have fought so hard.' — location: [139]() ^ref-57878

---
Anything of importance will remain; anything useless will disappear. However, it is not the warrior's responsibility to judge the dreams of others, and he does not waste time criticising other people's decisions. — location: [151]() ^ref-55806

---
If he waits for the ideal moment, he will never set off; he requires a touch of madness to take the next step. — location: [157]() ^ref-17992

---
The warrior uses that touch of madness. For - in both love and war - it is impossible to foresee everything. — location: [158]() ^ref-10998

---
A warrior of light knows his own faults. But he also knows his qualities — location: [159]() ^ref-55971

---
He tries to establish what he can truly rely on. And he always checks that he carries three things with him: faith, hope and love. — location: [164]() ^ref-48571

---
The warrior of light knows that no one is stupid and that life teaches everyone — location: [166]() ^ref-62294

---
however long that may take. — location: [166]() ^ref-52485

---
Every warrior of light has felt afraid of going into battle. — location: [170]() ^ref-32271

---
Every warrior of light has, at some time in the past, lied or betrayed someone. — location: [171]() ^ref-4489

---
Every warrior of light has trodden a path that was not his. — location: [171]() ^ref-50572

---
Every warrior of light has suffered for the most trivial of reasons. — location: [172]() ^ref-7787

---
Every warrior of light has, at least once, believed that he was not a warrior of light. — location: [173]() ^ref-11584

---
Every warrior of light has failed in his spiritual duties. — location: [173]() ^ref-3240

---
Every warrior of light has said 'yes' when he wanted to say 'no'. — location: [174]() ^ref-35259

---
Every warrior of light has hurt someone he loved. — location: [175]() ^ref-45882

---
That is why he is a warrior of light, because he has been through all this and yet has never lost hope of being better than he is. — location: [175]() ^ref-50234

---
The player on the other side is hidden from us, but we know that his play — location: [179]() ^ref-26190

---
is always fair, just and patient.' — location: [180]() ^ref-58154

---
A warrior of light does not postpone making decisions. — location: [182]() ^ref-41026

---
However, as soon as he has made a decision, the warrior proceeds: he has no doubts about his chosen action nor does he change direction if circumstances turn out differently — location: [184]() ^ref-8581

---
from how he had imagined them. — location: [185]() ^ref-3776

---
If his decision is correct, he will win the battle, even if it lasts longer than expected. If his decision is wrong, he will be defeated and he will have to start all over again - only this time with more wisdom. — location: [186]() ^ref-10929

---
But once he has started, a warrior of light perseveres until the end. — location: [187]() ^ref-24863

---
On the other sign, he reads: 'Who do you think you are, helping other people? Can't you see your own faults?' — location: [198]() ^ref-51625

---
A warrior of light shares his world with the people he loves. He tries to encourage them to do the things they would like to do but for which they lack the courage; at such times, the Enemy appears holding two wooden signs in his hand. On one sign is written: 'Think about yourself. Keep all the blessings for yourself, otherwise you'll end up losing everything.' — location: [194]() ^ref-45609

---
A warrior knows that he has faults. But he knows too that he cannot do his growing alone and thus distance himself from his companions — location: [198]() ^ref-26714

---
'When a beginner knows what he needs, he proves more intelligent than an absent-minded sage.' — location: [204]() ^ref-32667

---

---
in.' — location: [206]() ^ref-29741

---
The warrior of light meditates. — location: [207]() ^ref-40109

---
A warrior of light knows that in the silence of his heart he will hear an order that will guide him. — location: [212]() ^ref-31989

---
A warrior of light sometimes thinks: 'If I do not do something, it will not be done.' It is not quite like that: he must act, but he must allow room for the Universe to act too. — location: [216]() ^ref-14264

---
A warrior balances solitude and dependence. — location: [223]() ^ref-60709

---
A warrior of light makes use of solitude, but is not used by it. — location: [228]() ^ref-40161

---
The warrior of light knows that it is impossible to live in a state of complete relaxation. — location: [229]() ^ref-31655

---
He has learned from the archer that, in order to shoot his arrow any distance, he must hold the bow taut. He has learned from the stars that only an inner explosion allows them to shine. The warrior notices that when a horse is about to jump over a fence, it tenses all its muscles. — location: [230]() ^ref-40964

---
But he never confuses tension with anxiety. — location: [232]() ^ref-44122

---
That is why the warrior uses a mixture of discipline and compassion. God never abandons His children, but His purposes are unfathomable, and He builds the road with our own steps. — location: [235]() ^ref-1762

---
The warrior of light sometimes behaves like water, flowing around the obstacles he encounters. — location: [238]() ^ref-54368

---
And, after a certain point, its power is absolute. — location: [243]() ^ref-21254

---
The warrior of light has the qualities of a rock. When he is on flat terrain, everything around him is in harmony and he remains stable. People can build their houses upon him, and the storm will not destroy them. — location: [250]() ^ref-45653

---
A warrior of light thinks about both war and peace and knows how to act in accordance with the circumstances. — location: [254]() ^ref-25078

---
A bullfight lasts fifteen minutes; the bull quickly learns that it is being tricked, and its next step is to charge the bullfighter. When that happens, no amount of brilliance, argument, intelligence or charm can avert tragedy. — location: [257]() ^ref-59208

---
A warrior of light who trusts too much in his intelligence will end up underestimating the power of his opponent. — location: [255]() ^ref-44349

---
That is why the warrior never underestimates brute force. When it proves too violent, he withdraws from the battlefield until his enemy has exhausted himself. — location: [259]() ^ref-64586

---
The warrior of light knows when an enemy is stronger than he is. — location: [260]() ^ref-31598

---
In such situations, the warrior remains patient; the enemy will soon go off in search of others to provoke — location: [265]() ^ref-41309

---
A warrior of light is never indifferent to injustice. — location: [266]() ^ref-31952

---
He knows that all is one and that each individual action affects everyone on the planet. — location: [267]() ^ref-48700

---
That is why, when confronted by the suffering of others, he uses his sword to restore order. — location: [267]() ^ref-62658

---
But even though he fights against oppression, at no point does he attempt to judge the oppressor. Each person will answer for his actions before God and so, — location: [268]() ^ref-35155

---
warrior has completed his task, he makes no further comment. — location: [269]() ^ref-34868

---
once the — location: [269]() ^ref-58121

---
the warrior prefers to face defeat and then lick his wounds, because he knows that if he flees he is giving to the aggressor greater power than he deserves. — location: [272]() ^ref-30165

---
A warrior of light is never cowardly — location: [271]() ^ref-10626

---
But he knows that the act of forgiveness does not mean that he must accept everything; a warrior cannot bow his head, for if he did he would lose sight of the horizon of his dreams. — location: [291]() ^ref-29277

---
When he goes into battle, he remembers what Christ said: 'Love your enemies.' And he obeys. — location: [290]() ^ref-33649

---
They talk about his conquests, and any strangers who join the group are made welcome because everyone is proud of his life and of his Good Fight. The warrior speaks enthusiastically about the path, he tells how he resisted a particular challenge or speaks of the solution he found to one especially difficult situation. When he tells stories, he invests his words with passion and romance. — location: [306]() ^ref-30667

---
The warrior of light pays attention to small things because they can severely hamper him. — location: [323]() ^ref-62541

---
The warrior of light does not always have faith. There are moments when he believes in absolutely nothing. And he asks his heart: 'Is all this effort really worth it?' But his heart remains silent. And the warrior has to decide for himself — location: [328]() ^ref-21193

---
obstacles and experienced the same problems. But he knows how to deal with the situation better. — location: [346]() ^ref-60829

---
Because he uses fear as an engine, not as a brake. — location: [347]() ^ref-56914

---
That is why, whenever he finds himself before someone who fills him with fear, the warrior reminds himself that the other person has the same insecurities as he has. He has surmounted similar — location: [345]() ^ref-41338
