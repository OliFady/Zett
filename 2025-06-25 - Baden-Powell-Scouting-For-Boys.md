So, too, with a boy who has been accustomed to obey orders at once, whether there is risk about it or not; the moment you order him to do a thing on active service, no matter how great the danger is to him he does it, while another chap who has never cared to obey would object, and would then be despised as a coward even by his former friends. But you need not wait for war in order to be useful as a scout. As a peace scout there is lots for you to do any day, wherever you may be. — location: [283]() ^ref-16448

You all take the scout's oath, that is you promise, on your honour, three things, namely: 1. To be loyal to God and the King. 2. To help other people at all times. 3. To obey the scout law. — location: [403]() ^ref-12685
When you have learned sufficient to pass the test you can win the badge of either a first class or second class scout. — location: [411]() ^ref-29721

Campaigning.—Scouts must, of course, be accustomed to living in the open; they have to know how to put up tents or huts for themselves; how to lay and light a fire; how to kill, cut up, and cook their food; how to tie logs — location: [445]() ^ref-31055
together to make bridges and rafts; how to find their way by night, as well as by day, in a strange country, and so on. — location: [446]() ^ref-61960

Each knight had a small following of a squire and some men-at-arms, just as our patrol leader has his corporal and four or five scouts. The knight's patrol used to stick to him through thick and thin, and all carried out the same idea as their leader—namely: — location: [465]() ^ref-29152
Their honour was sacred. They were loyal to God, and their king, and to their country. They were particularly courteous and polite to all women and children and infirm people. They were helpful to everybody. They gave money and food where it was wanted and saved up their money in order to do so. They taught themselves the use of arms in order to protect their religion and their country against enemies. — location: [468]() ^ref-58300
They kept themselves strong and healthy and active in order to be able to do these things well. — location: [475]() ^ref-10189

A good turn need only be a very small one; if it is only to put a halfpenny into a poor box, or to help an old woman to cross the street, or to make room on a seat for someone, or to give water to a thirsty horse, or to remove a bit of banana skin off the pavement where it is likely to throw people down, — location: [483]() ^ref-36463

how to cover your mouth and nose with a wet handkerchief to enable you to breath in smoke, how to tear a sheet into strips and make a rope for escaping from fire, how to open a manhole to let air into a gassy sewer, how to lift and carry an insensible person, how to collar, save, and revive apparently drowned people, — location: [500]() ^ref-47007

Teach the scouts how to lift and carry an insensible man. Also how to drag an insensible man through smoke, gas, etc. Also how to cover nose and mouth with wet handkerchief. Divide them off into pairs, and let each in turn act as insensible patient to be rescued by his comrade. — location: [509]() ^ref-24558

A Court of Honour is formed of the scout master and two patrol leaders, or in the case of a single patrol by the patrol leader and the corporal. It decides rewards, punishments, and other questions. — location: [633]() ^ref-57122

A salute is merely a sign between men of standing. It is a privilege to be able to salute anyone. In the old days the free men of England all were allowed to carry weapons, and when they met each other each would hold up his right hand to show that he had no weapon in it, and that they met as friends. So also when an armed man met a defenceless person or a lady. — location: [728]() ^ref-10855

---
Each scout in the patrol has to be able to make the call of his patrol-animal—thus every scout in the "Ravens" must be able to imitate the croak of the raven. This is the sign by which scouts of a patrol can communicate with each other when hiding or at night. No scout is allowed to imitate the call of any patrol except his own. The patrol leader calls up the patrol at any time by sounding his whistle and uttering the call of the patrol. — location: [804]() ^ref-19663

A man walking puts the whole flat of his foot on the ground, each foot a little under a yard from the other. In running the toes are more deeply dug into the ground, and a little dirt is kicked up, and the feet are more than a yard apart. Sometimes men walk backwards in order to deceive anyone who may be tracking, but a good scout can generally tell this at once by the stride being shorter, the toes more turned in, and the heels being tightly impressed. — location: [1562]() ^ref-26191

---
With animals, if they are moving fast, their toes are more deeply dug into the ground, and they kick up the dirt, and their paces are longer than when going slowly. — location: [1566]() ^ref-14885

---
At a walk the horse makes two pairs of hoof prints—the near (left) hind foot close in front of near forefoot mark, and the off (right) forefoot similarly just behind the print of the off hindfoot. — location: [1569]() ^ref-37226

---
It was a trick with highwaymen of old, and with horse stealers more recently, to put their horses' shoes on wrong way round in order to deceive trackers who might try to follow them up, but a good tracker would not be taken in. Similarly, thieves often walk backwards for the same reason, but a clever tracker will very soon recognise the deception. — location: [1585]() ^ref-48571

---
So when you are observing a person don't do so by openly staring at them but notice the details you want to at one glance or two, and if you want to study them more, walk behind them; you can learn just as much from a backview, in fact, more than you can from a frontview, — location: [1851]() ^ref-19313

---
At night keep as much as possible in low ground, ditches, etc., so that you are down in the dark while an enemy who comes near will be visible to you outlined against the stars on higher ground. By squatting low in the shadow of the bush at night, and keeping quite still, I have let an enemy's scout come and stand within three feet of me, so that when he turned his back towards me I was able to stand up where I was and fling my arms round him. — location: [1874]() ^ref-29383

---
He does not, like the ordinary boy, want to go and rob them of their eggs, but he likes to watch how they hatch out their young and teach them to feed themselves and to fly. He gets to know every species of bird by its call and by its way of flying; and he knows which birds remain all the year round and which only come at certain seasons; and what kind of food they like best, and how they change their plumage; what sort of nests they build, where they build them, and what the eggs are like. — location: [2092]() ^ref-2277

---
You can also catch fish by netting, or, as scouts often have to do, by spearing them with a very sharp three-pronged spear. I have done it many a time, but it requires practice to be successful. — location: [2161]() ^ref-6576

---
I believe that fried snake, like fried eel, is not half bad. — location: [2165]() ^ref-34016

---
As far as snakes go, there are not, fortunately, many poisonous ones in England—only the viper is poisonous. It is differently marked from other snakes having a black V or arrow-head mark on its head and a dark zig-zag line along its back. It is generally dark brown in colour. The viper is sometimes called adder. — location: [2172]() ^ref-25726

---
Snakes don't like crawling over anything rough as a rule; so in India you often construct a kind of path made of sharp jagged stones all round a house to prevent snakes crawling into it from the garden. — location: [2178]() ^ref-46258

---
Poisonous snakes carry their poison in a small kind of bag inside their mouths. They have two fangs or long pointed teeth, which are on a kind of hinge; they lie flat along the snake's gums till he gets angry and wants to kill something; then they stand on end, and he dives his head forward and strikes them into his enemy. As he does so the poison passes out of the poison bag, or gland as it is called, into the two holes in your skin made by the fangs. This poison then gets into the veins of the man who has been bitten and is carried by the blood all over the body in a few seconds, unless steps are at once taken to stop it by sucking the wound and binding the veins up very tightly. — location: [2187]() ^ref-37604

---
There are numbers of berries, nuts, roots, barks, and leaves that are good to eat. The same with crops of different kinds of corn and seed, vegetable roots, and even grasses and vetches. Seaweed is much eaten in Ireland (Sloke) and Scotland. Certain kinds of moss are also used as food. — location: [2276]() ^ref-16229

---
So every scout ought to be able to tie knots. To tie a knot seems to be a simple thing, and yet there are right ways and wrong ways of doing it, and scouts ought to know the right way. Very often it may happen that lives depend on a knot being properly tied. The right kind of knot to tie is one which you can be certain will hold under any amount of strain, and which you can always undo easily if you wish to. — location: [2389]() ^ref-18072

Bowline, for making a loop that will not slip, such at you tie round a man when you want to rescue him from fire, etc. — location: [2407]() ^ref-9482

---
In making your roof, whether of branches of fir-trees, or of grass or reeds, etc., put them on as you would do tiles or slates, beginning at the bottom so that the upper overlap the lower ones and thus run off the rain without letting it through. Notice which direction the wind generally blows from and put the back of your shelter that way with your fire in front of it. — location: [2426]() ^ref-50739

---
If your tent or hut is too hot in the sun, put blankets or more straw, etc., over the top. The thicker the roof the cooler is the tent in summer. If it is too cold, make the bottom of the walls thicker, or build a small wall of sods about a foot high round the foot of the wall outside. Never forget to dig a good drain all round your hut, so that if heavy rain comes in the night your floor will not get flooded from outside. — location: [2435]() ^ref-26154

---
Framework of a Bivouac Shelter, to be thatched with brushwood or grass. A second lean-to roof on opposite side of ridge pole will then make a hut. — location: [2439]() ^ref-44776

---
There are many ways of making a comfortable bed in camp, but always if possible have some kind of covering over the ground between your body and the earth, especially after wet weather. Cut grass or straw or bracken are very good things to lay down thickly where you are going to lie, but if you cannot get any of these and are obliged to lie on the ground, do not forget before lying down to make a small hole about the size of a tea-cup in which your hip joint will rest when you are lying on your side; it makes all the difference for sleeping comfortably. — location: [2516]() ^ref-14468

---
Remember when sleeping in camp the secret of keeping warm is to have as many blankets underneath you as you have above you. — location: [2524]() ^ref-54315

---
Before lighting your fire remember always to do as every backwoodsman does, and that is to cut away or burn all bracken, heather, grass, etc., round the fire to prevent its setting light to the surrounding grass or bush. Many bad bush-fires have been caused by young tenderfoots fooling about with blazes which they imagined to be camp fires. — location: [2555]() ^ref-39176

---
Remember to begin your fire with a small amount of very small chips or twigs of really dry dead wood lightly heaped together and a little straw or paper to ignite it; about this should be put little sticks leaning together in the shape of a pyramid, and above this bigger sticks similarly standing on end. When the fire is well alight bigger sticks can be added, and, finally, logs of wood. — location: [2569]() ^ref-27054

---
Rest time for one hour and a half in middle of day. — location: [2622]() ^ref-15835

---
meat in some other way. This would usually be done by sticking it on sharp sticks and hanging it close to the fire so that it gets broiled; or the lid of an old biscuit tin can be used as a kind of frying-pan. Put grease or water in it to prevent the meat getting burnt before it is cooked. — location: [2649]() ^ref-49126

---
Meat can also be wrapped in a few sheets of wet paper or in a coating of clay and put in the red-hot embers of the fire, where it will cook itself. Birds and fish can also be cooked in this manner, and there is no need to pluck the bird before doing so if you use clay, as the feathers will stick to the clay when it hardens in the heat, and when you break it open the bird will come out cooked, without its feathers, like the kernel out of a nutshell. — location: [2651]() ^ref-56950

---
When boiling a pot of water on the fire, do not jam the lid on too firmly, as when the steam forms inside the pot it must have some means of escape or it will burst the pot. — location: [2675]() ^ref-25515

---
To find out when the water is beginning to boil, you need not take off the lid and look, but just hold the end of a stick, or knife, etc., to the pot, and if the water is boiling you will feel it trembling. — location: [2676]() ^ref-55869

Then he puts it on a gridiron over hot ashes, or sweeps part of the fire to one side, and on the hot ground left there he puts his dough, and piles hot ashes round it and lets it bake itself. — location: [2694]() ^ref-19198

---
To make bread, the usual way is for a scout to take off his coat, spread it on the ground, with the inside uppermost (so that any mess he makes in it will not show outwardly when he wears his coat afterwards); then he makes a pile of flour on the coat and scoops out the centre until it forms a cup for the water which he then pours in hot; he then mixes the dough with a pinch or two of salt, and of baking-powder or of Eno's Fruit Salt, and kneads and mixes it well together until it forms a lump of well-mixed dough. Then with a little fresh flour sprinkled over the hands to prevent the dough sticking to them, he pats it and makes it into the shape of a large bun or several buns. Then he puts it on a gridiron over hot ashes, or sweeps part of the fire to one side, and on the hot ground left there he puts his dough, and piles hot ashes round it and lets it bake itself. — location: [2689]() ^ref-44996

---
Sheep are generally killed either by being laid on their side and having their head drawn back and throat cut with a big sharp knife, or by being shot in the forehead with a revolver or blank cartridge of a rifle. The animal should then be gutted by having the belly slit open and the inside taken out, liver and kidneys being kept. — location: [2725]() ^ref-38320

---
For this reason you should be careful to keep your camp very clean, so that flies won't come there. All slops and scraps should be thrown away into a properly-dug hole, where they can be buried, and not scattered about all over the place. Patrol leaders must be very careful to see that this is always done. — location: [2742]() ^ref-17491

---
For the same reason it is very dangerous to drink out of streams, and especially out of ponds, when you feel thirsty, for you may suck down any amount of poison in doing so. If a pond is your only water-supply, it is best to dig a small well, three feet deep, about ten feet away from the pond, and the water will ooze through into it, and will be much more healthy to drink. We did this in Mafeking, when the Boers cut off our regular water-supply, and so had no sickness from bad water. — location: [2751]() ^ref-21849

---
If you are watching for an enemy at night you have to trust much more to your ears than to your eyes, and also to your nose, for a scout who is well-practised at smelling out things and who has not damaged his sense of smell by smoking, can often smell an enemy a good distance away. I have done it many times myself and found it of the greatest value. — location: [2902]() ^ref-47098

Red at night shepherd's delight (i.e., fine day coming). Red in morning is the shepherd's warning (i.e., rain). Yellow sunset means wind. Pale yellow sunset means rain. Dew and fog in early morning means fine weather. Clear distant view means rain coming or just past. Red dawn means fine weather—so does low dawn. High dawn is when sun rises over a bank of clouds; high above the horizon means wind. Soft clouds, fine weather. Hard edged clouds, wind. Rolled or jagged, strong wind. "When the wind's before the rain, Soon you may make sail again; When the rain's before the wind, Then your sheets and halyards mind." — location: [2914]() ^ref-23424

At 100 yards, eyes appear as dots; 200 yards, buttons and details of uniform can still be seen. At 300 yards, face can be seen; at 400 yards, the movement of the legs can be seen; at 500 yards the colour of the uniform can be seen. — location: [3012]() ^ref-43782

At six o'clock in the morning the sun is due east, at nine o'clock he is south-east, at noon he is south, at three o'clock in the afternoon he is south-west, and at six o'clock he is due west. In winter he will have set long before six o'clock, but he will not have reached due west when he is set. — location: [3023]() ^ref-47803

---
To find the south at any time of day by the sun—hold your watch flat, face upwards, so that the sun shines on it. Turn it round till the hour hand points at the sun. Then, without moving the watch, lay the edge of a piece of paper or a pencil across the face of the watch so that it rests on the centre of the dial and points out halfway between the Figure XII. and the hour hand. The line given by that pencil will be the true south and north line. — location: [3031]() ^ref-26131

Now the great point about Orion is that by him you always can tell which way the north or Pole Star lies, and which way the south, and you can see him whether you are in the south or the north part of the world. The Great Bear you only see when you are in the north, and the Southern Cross when you are in the south. — location: [3052]() ^ref-10177

Orion and his sword always point North and South. — location: [3064]() ^ref-54873

The way to estimate the distance across a river is to take an object X, such as a tree or rock on the opposite bank; start off at right angles to it from A, and pace, say, ninety yards along your bank; on arriving at sixty yards, plant a stick or stone, B; on arriving at C, thirty yards beyond that, that is ninety from the start, turn at right angles and walk inland, counting your paces until you bring the stick and the distant tree in line; the number of paces that you have taken from the bank C D will then give you the half distance across A X. — location: [3073]() ^ref-28312

---
To find the height of an object, such as a tree (A X), or a house, pace a distance of, say, eight yards away from it, and there at B plant a stick, say, six feet high; then pace on until you arrive at a point where the top of the stick comes in line C with the top of the tree; then the whole distance A C from the foot is to A X, the height of the tree, the same as the distance B C, from the stick, is to the height of the stick; that is if the whole distance A C is thirty-three feet, and the distance B C from the stick is nine (the stick being six feet high), the tree is twenty-two feet high. — location: [3080]() ^ref-53171

Every scout ought to learn the "dot and dash" or Morse method of signalling, because it comes in most useful whenever you want to send messages some distance by flag signalling, as in the Army and Navy, and it is also useful in getting you employment as a telegraphist. — location: [3160]() ^ref-46361

Whistle Signals are these: One long blast means: "Silence;" "Alert;" "Look out for my next signal." 1. A succession of long slow blasts means: "Go out;" "Get further away;" or "Advance;" "Extend;" "Scatter." 2. A succession of short, sharp blasts means: "Rally;" "Close in;" "Come together;" "Fall in." 3. A succession of short and long blasts alternately means: "Alarm;" "Look out;" "Be ready;" "Man your alarm posts." 4. Three short blasts followed by one long one, from scoutmaster calls up the patrol leaders—i.e. "Leaders come here!" Any whistle signal must be instantly obeyed at the double as fast as ever you can run—no matter what other job you may be doing at the time. Hand Signals, which can also be made by patrol leaders with their patrol flags when necessary. Hand waved several times across the face from side to side, or flag waved horizontally from side to side opposite the face means: "No; Never mind; As you were." Hand or flag held high, and waved very slowly from side to side at full extent of arm, or whistle a succession of slow blasts means: "Extend; Go further out; Scatter." Hand or flag held high and waved quickly from side to side at full extent of arm, or whistle a succession of short, quick blasts means: "Close in; Rally; Come here." Hand or flag pointing in any direction means: "Go in that direction." Hand or flag jumped rapidly up and down several times, means: "Run." Hand or flag held straight up over head, means: "Stop;" "Halt." When a leader is shouting an order or message to a scout who is some way off, the scout, if he hears what is being said, should hold up his hand level with his head all the time. If he cannot hear he should stand still making no sign. The leader will then repeat louder or beckon to the scout to come in nearer. — location: [3193]() ^ref-53375

It may not be always possible for you to get a bath every day, but you can at any rate rub yourself over with a wet towel, or scrub yourself with a dry one, and you ought not to miss a single day in doing this if you want to keep fit and well. — location: [3513]() ^ref-15590

Never start work in the morning without some sort of food inside you, if it is only a cup of hot water. Never bathe in deep water very soon after a meal, it is very likely to cause cramp, which doubles you up, and so you get drowned. — location: [3520]() ^ref-37577

Behind him rode his group, or patrol of men-at-arms—stout, hearty warriors, ready to follow their knight to the gates of death if need be. They were the tough yeomen of the old days, who won so many of her fine fights for Britain through their pluck and loyal devotion to their knights. In peace time, when there was no fighting to be done, the knight would daily ride about looking for a chance of doing a good turn to any wanting help, especially woman or child who might be in distress. When engaged in thus doing good turns he was called a "Knight Errant." His patrol naturally acted in the same way as their leader, and a man-at-arms was always equally ready to help the distressed with his strong right arm. The knights of old were the patrol leaders of the nation, and the men-at-arms were the scouts. — location: [3773]() ^ref-891

---
The laws of the knights were these: "Be Always Ready, with your armour on, except when you are taking your rest at night. Defend the poor, and help them that cannot defend themselves. Do nothing to hurt or offend anyone else. Be prepared to fight in the defence of England. At whatever you are working try and win honour and a name for honesty. Never break your promise. Maintain the honour of your country with your life. Rather die honest than live shamelessly. Chivalry requireth that youth should be trained to perform the most laborious and humble offices with cheerfulness and grace; and to do good unto others." — location: [3799]() ^ref-49711

The way to prevent a dog biting you is to hold a stick, or even a handkerchief, in your two hands across your front, and the dog will generally try to paw it down before he actually bites you, and you may thus get a chance of landing him a kick under the jaw. — location: [4686]() ^ref-37527

Artificial Breathing.—To restore anyone who is apparently drowned, it is necessary at once to clear the water out of his lungs, for which purpose therefore you should incline him face downwards and head downwards, so that the water may run out of his mouth, and to help it you should open his mouth and pull forward his tongue; take off the wet clothing and wrap him in blankets if possible, and rub and move his limbs as much as possible to get back the circulation of the blood. After running the water out of the patient, place him on his side with his body slightly hanging down, and keep the tongue hanging out. If he is breathing let him rest; if he is not breathing, you must at once endeavour to restore breathing artificially. Lay him flat on his front with his arm bent and placed under his forehead to keep his nose and mouth on the ground. Put a folded coat or pillow under his chest and let his head hang down. In this way his tongue will not block his throat, and any water or slime can run out. Then either stand astride of him or kneel alongside him, and, placing both your hands on his lower ribs, press steadily down and forwards to drive any air out of his body for three or four seconds, and then ease up to let the air come in again through the throat, then press down again. Continue this pressing and easing, counting four to each movement, until the patient begins to breathe again. Sometimes this doesn't happen till you have been trying for an hour or even more. This is called the Schafer method, and can be used equally well for drowned people or for those overcome with smoke or gas fumes. — location: [4715]() ^ref-27234

## Notes
- Baden Powell argues that a scout who always obeys the orders will be more reactive to his surroundings and will likely obey orders at tough times, even at risk.
- A scout must be able to survive at all times, in strange cities and difficult situations. He must be able to navigate his way through morning and night, build his own tent, light fires and make his meals
- Scouts take most of its rules from the knights of the great British kingdom. They take pride in being its protector and serving the king. 
- A scout knots his folard every morning to remember doing a small good thing.
- A salute is a sign of peace. when knights used to salute each other with their right hands, it shows that they hold no weapons.
