## Highlights
In all affairs, it’s a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted. — location: [946]() ^ref-39901

---
Every successful business (1) creates or provides something of value that (2) other people want or need (3) at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that (4) satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations, and (5) provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation. — location: [956]() ^ref-40604

---
Value can’t be created without understanding what people want (market research). Attracting customers first requires getting their attention, then making them interested (marketing). In order to close a sale, people must trust your ability to deliver on what’s promised (value delivery and operations). Customer satisfaction depends on exceeding the customer’s expectations (customer service). Profit sufficiency requires bringing in more money than is spent (finance). — location: [961]() ^ref-17788

---
Systems, on the other hand, are the invisible structures that hold every business together. At the core, every business is a collection of processes that can be repeated to produce a particular result. By understanding how complex systems work, it’s possible to find ways to improve existing systems, whether you’re dealing with a marketing campaign or an automotive assembly line. — location: [970]() ^ref-57492

College: two hundred people reading the same book. An obvious mistake. Two hundred people can read two hundred books. — location: [998]() ^ref-3579

Make something people want . . . There’s nothing more valuable than an unmet need that is just becoming fixable. If you find something broken that you can fix for a lot of people, you’ve found a gold mine. — location: [1340]() ^ref-46259

---
Value Creation—discovering what people need or want, then creating it. Marketing—attracting attention and building demand for what you’ve created. Sales—turning prospective customers into paying customers. Value Delivery—giving your customers what you’ve promised and ensuring that they’re satisfied. Finance—bringing in enough money to keep going and make your effort worthwhile. — location: [1365]() ^ref-54975

Market matters most. And neither a stellar team nor a fantastic product will redeem a bad market. . . . Markets that don’t exist don’t care how smart you are. — location: [1393]() ^ref-29343

---
The problem wasn’t that the product was poorly designed. The technology that makes the Segway work is sophisticated, and the benefits are significant: the Segway is a convenient, green urban car replacement. The problem was that very few people cared enough to spend $5,000 on a goofy-looking alternative to walking or riding a bike—the massive market that Kamen expected didn’t exist. — location: [1403]() ^ref-41004

---
Maslow’s theory was that people progress through five general stages in the pursuit of what they need: physiology, safety, belonging/love, esteem, and self-actualization. Physiology represents the “lowest” level of human need, while self-actualization (the exploration of a person’s innate potential) is the “highest.” — location: [1420]() ^ref-37576

---
In practice, I prefer Clayton Alderfer’s version of Maslow’s hierarchy, which he called “ERG theory”: people seek existence, relatedness, and growth, in that order. When people have what they need to survive, they move on to making friends and finding mates. When they’re satisfied with their relationships, they focus on doing things they enjoy and improving their skills in things that interest them. First existence, then relatedness, then growth. — location: [1425]() ^ref-60085

The Drive to Defend—the desire to protect ourselves, — location: [1439]() ^ref-11332

---
The Drive to Feel—the desire for new sensory stimuli, intense emotional experiences, pleasure, excitement, entertainment, and anticipation. — location: [1442]() ^ref-540

---
At the core, all successful businesses sell the promise of some combination of money, status, power, love, knowledge, protection, pleasure, and excitement. The better you articulate how your offer satisfies one or more of these drives, the more attractive your offer will become. — location: [1447]() ^ref-27448

---
In addition to understanding Core Human Drives, it’s important to understand that humans are social creatures. Like many other mammals, humans evolved to have a pecking order, a relative ranking of Power or status in a group. — location: [1455]() ^ref-28126

---
Social Status is a universal phenomenon: neurotypical human beings care about what other people think of them and spend a significant amount of energy tracking their relative status compared to other members of their group. When opportunities to increase status appear, most people will seize them. — location: [1460]() ^ref-16903

Urgency. How badly do people want or need this right now? (Renting an old movie is low urgency; seeing the first showing of a new movie on opening night is high urgency, since it only happens once.) — location: [1484]() ^ref-10146

---
Market Size. How many people are purchasing things like this? (The market for underwater basket-weaving courses is very small; the market for cancer cures is massive.) — location: [1485]() ^ref-46771

Pricing Potential. What is the highest price a typical purchaser would be willing to spend for a solution? (Lollipops sell for $0.05; aircraft carriers sell for billions.) — location: [1486]() ^ref-26389

Cost of Customer Acquisition. How easy is it to acquire a new customer? On average, how much will it cost to generate a sale, in both money and effort? — location: [1488]() ^ref-64160

Cost of Value Delivery. How much will it cost to create and deliver the value offered, in both money and effort? (Delivering files via the internet is almost free; inventing a product and building a factory costs millions.) — location: [1490]() ^ref-59012

---
Uniqueness of Offer. How unique is your offer versus competing offerings in the market, and how easy is it for potential competitors to copy you? — location: [1492]() ^ref-45612

---
Speed to Market. How soon can you create something to sell? (You can offer to mow a neighbor’s lawn in minutes; opening a bank can take years.) — location: [1494]() ^ref-16878

---
Up-front Investment. How much will you have to invest before you’re ready to sell? (To be a housekeeper, all you need is a set of inexpensive cleaning products. To mine for gold, you need millions to purchase land and excavating equipment.) — location: [1495]() ^ref-24662

---
Evergreen Potential. Once the initial offer has been created, how much additional work will you have to put in in order to continue selling? (Business consulting requires ongoing work to get paid; a book can be produced once and then sold over and over as is.) — location: [1499]() ^ref-4550

---
The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time. — location: [1507]() ^ref-13097

---
Cheer up: there are Hidden Benefits of Competition. When any two markets are equally attractive in other respects, you’re better off choosing to enter the one with competition. Here’s why: it means you know from the start there’s a market of paying customers for this idea, eliminating your biggest risk. The existence of a market means you’re already on the right side of the Iron Law of the Market, so you can spend more time developing your offer instead of proving a market exists — location: [1512]() ^ref-35310

Unbundling is the opposite of Bundling: it’s taking one offer and splitting it up into multiple offers. A good example of Unbundling is selling downloads of a single song instead of the entire album. Customers may not be willing to pay $10 for the album, but they might be willing to pay a dollar or two for the songs they like. Unbundling the album into individual units opens the way to sales that wouldn’t otherwise happen. — location: [1878]() ^ref-18776

The more offers contained in the bundle, the higher the Perceived Value of the offer and the more the business can charge. That’s why mobile phone providers offer additional minutes, unlimited text messaging, and internet service on top of the basic service plan. The more benefits provided, the more a customer is often willing to pay on a monthly basis for the entire package. Unbundling is the opposite of Bundling: it’s taking one offer and splitting it up into multiple offers. A good example of Unbundling is selling downloads of a single song instead of the entire album. Customers may not be willing to pay $10 for the album, but they might be willing to pay a dollar or two for the songs they like. Unbundling the album into individual units opens the way to sales that wouldn’t otherwise happen. Bundling and Unbundling can help you create value for different types of customers without requiring the creation of something new. By combining offers and forms in various configurations, you can offer your customers what they want. — location: [1875]() ^ref-46793

That’s why residential real estate agents have a market: potential home buyers often don’t know the options (particularly if they’re not familiar with the area), don’t have a lot of experience completing these sorts of Transactions, and feel overwhelmed. Real estate agents assist in the search, purchase decision, and closing process, and home buyers are often happy to work with someone who knows what they’re doing. The term for this sort of help is Intermediation: adding a party between the buyer and seller responsible for helping one of the parties complete the Transaction or derive value from the purchase. — location: [1893]() ^ref-35813

---
The stereotypical product development model is shrouded in secrecy: develop the offer in private, make everyone involved sign nondisclosure agreements,2 raise millions of dollars in venture capital, spend years making it perfect, then unveil your creation to the astonishment of the world and the thunderous sound of ringing cash registers. This mentality ruins careers and empties bank accounts. On their own, ideas are worthless—discovering whether or not you can make them work in reality is the most important job of any entrepreneur. — location: [1915]() ^ref-64844

---
The Prototype is your first attempt at creating something useful, but it won’t be your last. Your first will be poor and incomplete, and that’s okay. Prototypes are valuable because they allow you to get good feedback from real people before you invest a huge amount of time, money, and effort into the project. The purpose of a Prototype is not to make it perfect: it’s to create a tangible focus for your efforts—something you and other people can see, evaluate, and improve. — location: [1931]() ^ref-49364

---
The Iteration Cycle is a process you can use to make anything better over time. There’s nothing wasteful about the inevitable changes and revisions that these artists made to their creations: every iteration brought the project one step closer to completion. — location: [1944]() ^ref-44379

---
Feedback No business plan survives first contact with customers. — location: [1975]() ^ref-54171

---
Get Feedback from real potential customers instead of friends and family. Your inner circle wants you to succeed and wants to maintain a good relationship with you, so it’s likely that they’ll unintentionally sugarcoat their Feedback. For best results, be sure to get plenty of Feedback from people who aren’t personally invested in you or your project. Ask open-ended questions. When collecting Feedback, you should be listening more than you talk. Have a few open-ended questions prepared — location: [1981]() ^ref-51974

---
Take what you hear with a grain of salt. Even the most discouraging Feedback contains crucial pieces of information that can help you make your offering better. The worst response you can get when asking for Feedback isn’t emphatic dislike: it’s total apathy. If no one seems to care about what you’ve created, you don’t have a viable business idea. — location: [1989]() ^ref-5736

It’s one thing for a person to say that they’d purchase something and quite another for them to be willing to pull out their wallet or credit card and place a real order. You can do this even if the offer isn’t ready yet—a tactic called Shadow Testing. Whenever possible, give the people who are giving you Feedback the opportunity to preorder the offering. If a significant number of people take you up on the offer, you’re in good shape: you know that you have a solid offering and you boost your cash flow. If no one is willing to preorder, you know you have more work to do before you have a viable offer. — location: [1993]() ^ref-57777

Examining the possible Alternatives and considering the customer’s perspective results in better choices. As you make decisions about what to include and what to leave out, it’s essential to appreciate the Alternatives that your potential customers face when they decide whether or not to purchase your offering. Once you’re aware of the options, you can examine the combinations and permutations of those Alternatives to present an attractive offer. — location: [2021]() ^ref-1083

Trade-offs I can’t give you a surefire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time. — location: [2027]() ^ref-17683

Economic Values A successful business is either loved or needed. — location: [2047]() ^ref-60685

---
As a rule, people never accept Trade-offs unless they’re forced to make a Decision. If the perfect option existed, they’d buy it. Since there’s no such thing as the perfect offering, people are happy to settle for the Next Best Alternative. — location: [2087]() ^ref-63077

---
It won’t take the participant long to provide a response to each of these simple questions, but the results are quite revealing. By asking the participant to make an actual choice, you’re collecting more accurate information about how the participant would respond when faced with a similar choice in the real world. When the results are aggregated and analyzed, the relative importance of each benefit becomes very clear. The more sets each participant completes, the better you’ll be able to judge the relative importance of each benefit.4 Relative Importance Testing can help you determine which benefits you should focus on to make your offering maximally attractive. — location: [2105]() ^ref-55251

Stories like this are very common: an excited first-time entrepreneur has a dream of owning a restaurant, bar, or bookstore, so they invest their life’s savings and take on significant debt to open the new business. Sometimes these stories work out well. More often than not, in a few months the new entrepreneur is bankrupt and out of business, wondering how things went so terribly wrong. Critical Assumptions are facts or characteristics that must be true in the real world for your business or offering to be successful. Every business or offering has a set of Critical Assumptions that will make or break its continued existence: if any of these Critical Assumptions turns out to be false, the business idea will be less promising than it appears. The previous yoga studio example has three primary Critical Assumptions: Individuals in this neighborhood will be willing to commit to pay $100 or more per month for a yoga membership close to their home. The business will be able to attract at least 220 members paying full price within three months. Total monthly revenues will exceed $22,000 for the next twelve months, which is the minimum duration of the lease term. — location: [2125]() ^ref-47765

---
keep the studio afloat. After lowering prices, membership reaches the 220-member mark as planned, but it’s not — location: [2137]() ^ref-46700

---
The studio doesn’t attract enough members to pay the bills because yoga enthusiasts in the neighborhood are already locked into twelve-month membership contracts with a studio a few miles away. The studio runs out of money and closes. A very nice competing studio opens up in the same neighborhood around the same time. After three months, the studio only has half of the members it needs to sustain itself. With nine more months on the lease, the financial outlook is bleak. — location: [2138]() ^ref-64971

---
The best way to validate the truth of your Critical Assumptions is to test them, but going through the entire process of starting the business is needlessly risky and expensive. It’s much smarter to minimize your risk by testing your offering with real paying customers before you fully commit to making it real. Shadow Testing is the process of selling an offering before it exists. As long as you’re up front with your potential customers that the offering is still in development, Shadow Testing is a very useful strategy you can use to test your Critical Assumptions with real customers. — location: [2148]() ^ref-14749

A Minimum Viable Offer is an offer that promises and/or provides the smallest number of benefits necessary to produce an actual sale. A Minimum Viable Offer is a Prototype that’s been developed to the point that someone will pull out their wallet and commit to making a purchase. It doesn’t have to be complicated: Fitbit’s Minimum Viable Offer was a Prototype, a description, and a few computer renderings. All you need to do is convey enough information to convince a real potential customer to buy. Creating a Minimum Viable Offer is useful because it’s impossible to predict with 100 percent accuracy what will work in advance. You don’t want to invest a ton of time and money in something that has no chance of working, and the faster you can figure out if your idea will work or not, the better off you’ll be. — location: [2171]() ^ref-31485

---
The purpose of starting with a Minimum Viable Offer is to minimize your risk. By keeping the investments small, incremental, and learning oriented, you’ll be able to discover what works and what doesn’t. — location: [2194]() ^ref-44914

---
Incremental Augmentation is the process of using the Iteration Cycle to add new benefits to an existing offer. The process is simple: keep making and testing additions to the core offer, continue doing what works, and stop doing what doesn’t. — location: [2206]() ^ref-58634

The secret behind Kifaru’s quality is Field Testing. Smith personally creates, uses, and Iterates every single product Kifaru makes for years before offering it to customers. By the time the finished product is available, even the most demanding customers have a difficult time finding flaws. — location: [2230]() ^ref-41021

---
Offering value is not enough. If no one knows (or cares) about what you have to offer, it doesn’t matter how much value you create. Without marketing, no business can survive—people who don’t know you exist can’t purchase what you have to offer, and people who aren’t interested in what you have to offer won’t become paying customers. — location: [2255]() ^ref-60430

---
Attention doesn’t matter if people don’t care about what you’re doing. If all you’re looking for is attention, don’t bother with all of this business stuff: skipping down the street in a pink bunny suit while yelling at the top of your lungs will get you all the attention you’ll ever want. When it comes to business, however, some kinds of attention aren’t worth having. You want the attention of prospects who will purchase from you—otherwise, you’re wasting your time. — location: [2278]() ^ref-42398

---
Receptivity has two primary components: what and when. People tend to be receptive only to certain categories of things at certain times. I love hearing about interesting new business books, but I never want to be on the receiving end of a 3:00 a.m. phone call from a publicist. — location: [2296]() ^ref-29630

---
If you want your message to be heard, the medium matters. The form of your message has a big influence on how receptive people are to the information that message contains. If the form of your message suggests that it was created just for them, you’re far more likely to get your prospect’s attention. Here’s an example: Almost everyone will ignore postal junk mail—if it looks commercial or mass-produced, there’s a 99 percent chance the recipient will throw it away without a second thought. Change the form, however, and Receptivity changes as well: most people will at least open a hand-addressed envelope, since it’s clear someone spent time and effort sending it to them. — location: [2298]() ^ref-20811

From a business perspective, the Attention-grabbing design of FiveFingers is working beautifully. On the street, salespeople confirm that FiveFingers are flying off the shelves—new stock sells out almost immediately. According to the New York Times,1 sales of the FiveFingers line have tripled every year since they were introduced in 2006, and in 2009 the company’s revenue crossed the $10 million mark in North America—without mass-market advertising. Not bad for funny-looking frog shoes. — location: [2320]() ^ref-9929

---
Remarkability is the best way to attract Attention. In the classic marketing book Purple Cow, Seth Godin uses a wonderful metaphor to illustrate this principle: A field full of brown cows is boring. A purple cow violates the viewer’s expectations, which attracts Attention and interest. — location: [2325]() ^ref-41325

Skilled marketers don’t try to get everyone’s attention—they focus on getting the attention of the right people at the right time. If you’re marketing Harley-Davidson motorcycles, trying to land an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show to show off this year’s new models probably isn’t the best strategy. Likewise, Oprah’s core audience is not likely to include tough guys in leather jackets — location: [2339]() ^ref-11305

---
The best marketing meets the prospect where they are, not where you want them to be. If you want to attract Attention in a way that produces results, you need to be sensitive to how much your Probable Purchasers know and care about what you have to offer. — location: [2371]() ^ref-15007

Most women don’t buy a $20 tube of lipstick for its color alone. They buy it because they believe it will make them more beautiful and desirable. — location: [2400]() ^ref-11478

Certain markets have obvious entry and exit points. Learning a newborn is on the way is an example of a Point of Market Entry. Once you know you’re expecting, you’re suddenly much more receptive to information about products and services that will help you take care of a child. Attempting to attract the Attention of people who don’t care about what you do is a waste of time, money, and energy, so it’s best to find out when people are interested in hearing from you before you reach out. Attracting your Probable Purchaser’s Attention just after they’ve reached the Point of Market Entry is valuable. — location: [2468]() ^ref-22054

Yoga is a good example of a highly Addressable market. It’s relatively easy to find places where people are already paying attention to yoga-related information: studios, popular magazines like Yoga Journal, conferences, websites, etc. Yoga is a $16 billion industry, and you can tap into some or all of these outlets to help yogis and yoginis learn more about what you have to offer. Sensitive or embarrassing topics tend to have low Addressability, even if there’s a huge need. Chronic medical conditions are a good example: — location: [2497]() ^ref-25605

---
The internet has improved the Addressability of most markets. People who have a sensitive medical condition are highly likely to search for information on the internet, where they are Addressable via advertising. Blogs, discussion boards, and databases like WebMD make it easier for people who don’t know one another to share their experiences and knowledge, making these low-Addressability markets more accessible than ever before. — location: [2505]() ^ref-12431

As soon as you step onto the lot of a car dealership, the salesperson you work with has a single, clear objective: convince you to get behind the wheel of a vehicle for a test drive.

If you want to attract Attention, give something valuable away for Free. People love the promise of getting something for nothing. You’ve probably seen Free samples of food being given away at the supermarket, or received an offer to try a product or service for a certain time at no obligation. Chances are, at least a few of those free offers have led you to purchase more. Offers of Free value continue to exist because they work—the Free value is subsidized by the additional sales that are made because of the offer. — location: [2591]() ^ref-44771

Building a strong Reputation is valuable: people are often willing to pay a premium for a good Reputation. One of the reasons well-known consumer brands like Tide and Crest can continue to charge premium prices in near-commodity categories is the strength of their Reputation. Potential customers want to feel certain that the purchase they’re considering will benefit them, that others will think highly of their decision, and that they won’t be wasting their money. As the venerable corporate saying goes, “No one ever got fired for buying IBM.” — location: [2747]() ^ref-45928

There are four ways to support a price on something of value: (1) replacement cost, (2) market comparison, (3) discounted cash flow/net present value, and (4) value comparison.

The discounted cash flow (DCF)/ net present value (NPV) method supports a price by answering the question “How much is it worth if it can bring in money over time?” In the case of your house, the question becomes “How much would this house bring in each month if you rented it for a period of time, and how much is that series of cash flows worth as a lump sum today?” — location: [2874]() ^ref-10070

---
Most people who are new to business assume that the best way to increase sales is to reduce prices. That’s not necessarily true. Often, raising your prices is an effective way to attract more customers. Discounts attract customers when the offer is a commodity. If there’s no difference between the gasoline at one gas station and another, the station that reduces its gas prices may bring in more customers. Since most service stations make more money from their convenience stores than they make selling gasoline, a gas discounting strategy may lead to higher profits. — location: [2900]() ^ref-24286

As you test different pricing strategies, you’ll notice thresholds where you stop appealing to certain types of customers and start appealing to customers with very different characteristics.

One of the businesses I’ve been involved with over the years succeeded in doubling its average order value by eliminating low-priced offers. As a result, profits increased. As a Second-Order Effect, the company’s typical customer changed for the worse: prospects made unreasonable demands more often and acted in disrespectful ways when those demands weren’t met. The short-term financial result was positive, but the change placed extraordinary stress on the staff. — location: [2918]() ^ref-54312

Value-Based Selling is not about talking—it’s about listening. When most people think of sales, they imagine a pushy, smooth-talking shyster whose sole priority is to “close the deal.” Emulating shady used car dealers is the fastest way to destroy Trust and give your potential customers the impression that you care more about your bottom line than about what they want. In reality, the best salespeople are the ones who can listen intently for the things the customer wants. — location: [2943]() ^ref-58559

(1) understanding the situation, (2) defining the problem, (3) clarifying the short-term and long-term implications of that problem, and (4) quantifying the need-payoff, or the financial and emotional benefits the customer would experience after the resolution of their problem. Instead of barging in with a premature, boilerplate hard sell, successful salespeople focus on asking detailed questions to get to the root of what the prospect wants. — location: [2948]() ^ref-49487

Education-Based Selling Upgrade your user, not your product. “Value” is less about the stuff and more about the stuff the stuff enables. Don’t build better cameras—build better photographers. — location: [2959]() ^ref-39394

In most sales situations, it’s in your best interest to maintain Exclusivity: creating a unique offer or benefit that other firms can’t match. If you’re the only person or company that offers what your prospect wants, you’re in a very strong position to negotiate on favorable terms. If you want to purchase an iPhone, you have to buy it through Apple: it is the sole source. You may purchase the product directly or through a retailer: either way, Apple gets paid. So long as you want an iPhone and aren’t willing to settle for an alternative, Apple wins. — location: [3012]() ^ref-8414

Buffers can also be useful in order to add some time or space to a high-intensity negotiation. It’s often quite useful not to be the party who has the final say. Being able to say, “I need to discuss this with my agent/accountant/attorney” before giving final approval on a deal is a valuable check step that prevents hasty or unwise decisions. — location: [3113]() ^ref-40606

The more effective strategy, in the words of the renowned sales expert Zig Ziglar, is to present yourself to the prospect as an “assistant buyer.” Your job is not to sell the prospect a bill of goods: it’s to help them make an informed decision about what’s best for them. You’re not pressuring them to give you their money; you’re helping to ensure they invest their resources wisely. This basic Reinterpretation of your role in the sales process works: it eliminates the prospect’s feeling of pressure — location: [3142]() ^ref-29783

These facts didn’t prevent us from leasing the apartment, but we were glad to know them in advance, and it increased our estimation of their integrity. We weighed the risks, increased our renter’s insurance, purchased a can of bear pepper spray, and signed the lease. Counterintuitively, making a Damaging Admission like this to your prospects can increase their Trust in your ability to deliver what you promise. — location: [3196]() ^ref-38913

To help alleviate our concerns, the dealership that listed the car went out of their way to photograph every detail—including a small chip in the paint on the left side, which wasn’t a big deal. Because they were willing to include even the small flaws in their description before we purchased, we felt more confident that they had thoroughly described the vehicle. We purchased it, and everything was as described. Without making a Damaging Admission, the dealer wouldn’t have made the sale. — location: [3202]() ^ref-35909

Option Fatigue is often a major barrier to buying decisions: if a prospect is overwhelmed by Decisions, they often choose to resolve their discomfort by abandoning the purchase instead of completing it. — location: [3219]() ^ref-11110

There’s always a reason a prospect says no. The fact that they’re even talking with you implies that they have at least some interest in your offer—otherwise, the conversation would end. There’s still hope of closing the sale, if you start asking the right questions. — location: [3233]() ^ref-64899

Objection 1 (“It costs too much”) is best addressed via Framing and Value-Based Selling. If you’re selling a piece of software to a business that can save them $10 million a year, and you’re asking $1 million a year for a license, your software isn’t expensive—it’s almost Free. If it’s clear that the value of your offer far exceeds the asking price, this objection is moot. — location: [3248]() ^ref-55741

Objections 2 and 3 (“It won’t work” / “It won’t work for me”) are best addressed via Social Proof—showing the prospect how customers just like them are already benefiting from your offer. The more like your prospect’s situation your stories and testimonials are, the better. That’s why Referrals are such a powerful sales tool—customers tend to refer people who have similar situations and needs, and the Referral itself helps break down these objections. — location: [3252]() ^ref-26870

Objections 4 and 5 (“I can wait” / “It’s too difficult”) are best addressed via Education-Based Selling. Often, your prospects haven’t fully realized they have a problem, particularly in the case of Absence Blindness. If the business doesn’t realize it’s losing $10 million in the first place, it’s difficult to convince them that you can help. — location: [3256]() ^ref-40733

Netflix is a company that uses Reactivation in a brilliant way. If you cancel a Netflix subscription, three to six months later you’ll receive a postcard and/or email with an offer to resubscribe at a reduced rate. If you don’t reply, they’ll send another message every few months until you resubscribe or request to be removed from their marketing system. Since Netflix is a Subscription business, every reactivated customer means an additional monthly stream of income, which greatly enhances the Lifetime Value of each customer. — location: [3310]() ^ref-7521

Direct-to-user distribution works across a single channel: from the business to the end user. Services are a classic example: when you get a haircut, the value is provided by the business itself to you, with no intermediary. Direct-to-user distribution is simple and effective, but it has limitations—you have full control of the entire process, but you can only serve as many customers as your time and energy allow. Once demand for your offer outpaces your ability to deliver it, you’re risking disappointing your customers and diminishing your Reputation. — location: [3381]() ^ref-24588

There are two basic types of Distribution Channels: direct-to-user and intermediary. Direct-to-user distribution works across a single channel: from the business to the end user. Services are a classic example: when you get a haircut, the value is provided by the business itself to you, with no intermediary. Direct-to-user distribution is simple and effective, but it has limitations—you have full control of the entire process, but you can only serve as many customers as your time and energy allow. Once demand for your offer outpaces your ability to deliver it, you’re risking disappointing your customers and diminishing your Reputation. Intermediary distribution works across multiple channels. When you purchase a Product from a store, that store is engaging in Resale. The store (in most cases) doesn’t manufacture the Products—it purchases them from another business. — location: [3380]() ^ref-39870

Intermediary distribution can increase sales, but it requires giving up a certain amount of control over your value-delivery process. Trusting another business to deliver your offer to your customers frees up your limited time and energy, but it also increases Counterparty Risk—the risk that your partner will screw up and diminish your Reputation. — location: [3390]() ^ref-5360

No one wants their favorite soda to taste different every time they drink it. When you open a can of Coke, you expect the same product as you had the last time, no matter where you are in the world. If even 0.1 percent of the cans of Coca-Cola sold were flat or sour, people would stop buying. Consistency means delivering the same value over time. One of the reasons “New Coke” failed in the mid-1980s was that customers expected Coke to taste a certain way, and the company delivered something new under the same name.

Quality Signals are elements of an offer designed to increase the user’s perception of Quality in a direct, tangible way.

Dish detergent doesn’t need to produce fluffy white bubbles in dishwater in order to work, but the presence of bubbles is a tangible indicator the detergent is present. Soap manufacturers like Procter & Gamble don’t add a “sudsing agent” to soap without good reason: the additional raw materials increase the cost and complexity of production, but increased customer satisfaction makes it a worthwhile investment. — location: [3500]() ^ref-15731

In the same vein, instead of trying to compete with commodity laptop manufacturers like Asus, HP, and Dell in the category of netbooks (small, low-powered computers designed for portability), Apple avoided the market for years. That changed when the iPad was launched in 2010—an offer that redefined the market instead of competing with preexisting netbooks on features. In the first two months of its existence, the company sold more than two million units. By choosing to innovate instead of compete, Apple successfully captured a leadership share of a very competitive market. — location: [3648]() ^ref-48429
