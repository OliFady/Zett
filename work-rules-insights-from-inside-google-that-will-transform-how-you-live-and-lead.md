## Highlights
“When employees trust the leadership, they become brand ambassadors and in turn cause progressive change in their families, society, and environment. The return on investment to business is automatic, with greater productivity, business growth, and inspired customers.” — location: [143]() ^ref-10156

the default leadership style at Google is one where a manager focuses not on punishments or rewards but on clearing roadblocks and inspiring her team. — location: [181]() ^ref-29150

So what did? Performance improved only when companies implemented programs to empower employees (for example, by taking decision-making authority away from managers and giving it to individuals or teams), provided learning opportunities that were outside what people needed to do their jobs, increased their reliance on teamwork (by giving teams more autonomy and allowing them to self-organize), or a combination of these. These factors “accounted for a 9% increase in value added per employee in our study.” In short, only when companies took steps to give their people more freedom did performance improve. — location: [195]() ^ref-3090

People spend most of their lives at work, but work is a grinding experience for most—a means to an end. It doesn’t have to be. — location: [211]() ^ref-31132

“I think about how far we’ve come as companies from those days, where workers had to protect themselves from the company. My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they’re having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society. As a world, we’re doing a better job of that. My goal is for Google to lead, not follow.”36 — location: [366]() ^ref-46806

WORK RULES…FOR BECOMING A FOUNDER  Choose to think of yourself as a founder.  Now act like one. — location: [375]() ^ref-49407

There’s ample data showing that most assessment occurs in the first three to five minutes of an interview (or even more quickly),70 with the remaining time being spent confirming that bias; that interviewers are subconsciously biased toward people like themselves; and that most interview techniques are worthless. Remember when George W. Bush met Vladimir Putin and reported that “I looked the man in the eye.… I was able to get a sense of his soul.”71 — location: [759]() ^ref-63802

At Google, we front-load our people investment. This means the majority of our time and money spent on people is invested in attracting, assessing, and cultivating new hires. We spend more than twice as much on recruiting, as a percentage of our people budget, as an average company. If we are better able to select people up front, that means we have less work to do with them once they are hired. The worst case with a 90th percentile candidate is that they have an average year. They are unlikely to become the worst performer in the company. An average candidate, however, will not only consume massive training resources, but is also just as likely to end up performing well below average as above average. — location: [793]() ^ref-32271

For the remaining people, some choose to leave and others we need to fire. It sounds harsh, but they tend to end up happier because we’ve shown sensitivity to their situation and invested in them along the way, and we give them time to find an organization where they can excel. I once had to terminate someone who worked for me, who upon exiting told me, “I’d never be able to do your job.” I said, “You can, but at a place where the demands are different.” Three years later, he called me to share that he’d been promoted to chief human resources officer — location: [2357]() ^ref-8929

Give people slightly more trust, freedom, and authority than you are comfortable giving them. If you’re not nervous, you haven’t given them enough. — location: [4790]() ^ref-61432

Admit your mistake. Be transparent about it.  Take counsel from all directions.  Fix whatever broke.  Find the moral in the mistake, and teach it. — location: [4838]() ^ref-5210
