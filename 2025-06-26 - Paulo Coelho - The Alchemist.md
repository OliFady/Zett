“The desert takes our men from us, and they don’t always return,” she said. “We know that, and we are used to it. Those who don’t return become a part of the clouds, a part of the animals that hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth. They become a part of everything… they become the Soul of the World. — location: [911]() ^ref-44026

## Notes
- When you want something, the whole universe (God, family, friends, ..etc.) helps u in achieving it. The obstacles you see are the way instead of in the way.
- Paulo debates the existence of people after their death. he believes they become a part of the world. I think that until they're forgetten, they remain in our hearts.
- True love never prevents a man from pursuing his dreams and destiny. If it means to obstruct him, then it's not true love. Love should encourage your dreams instead of destroy them.
- Always listen to your heart, your gut and your thoughts. What stays inside you blows up at a certain point. might as well make something of it while it's inside.
